  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons lemon pepper </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pepper </li>
    <li>1 pound catfish fillets </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
    <li>1 cup Italian-style salad dressing </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. </li>
    <li>In a shallow, medium bowl, mix cayenne pepper, lemon pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper. </li>
    <li>Brush both sides of catfish fillets with butter. Rub fillets with the cayenne pepper mixture on both sides.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li>
    <li>Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until really hot. Add fillets, and fry approximately 2 minutes on each side, until slightly blackened. </li>
    <li>Arrange blackened fillets in a single layer in the prepared baking dish, and coat with Italian-style salad dressing. Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is easily flaked with a fork. </li>
